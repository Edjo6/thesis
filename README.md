# Evaluation of Machine Learning models on-device vs on-cloud
## Authors: Edwin Johansson & Klas Stegmayr
### Explanation
This study is done as a software engineering bachelors degree thesis att Linnaeus University in Kalmar. It aims to evaluate at Convolutional Neural Network model on-cloud and on-device through image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The techniques that will be used are: TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, coremltools and Keras.
